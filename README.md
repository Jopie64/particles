# What is this?

It's a toy project. I just want to have fun with particles in a 2d/3d world.
Also I like to get more familiar with React and three.js.

# Install and run

It's a React app.

For first time usage run
```
npm i
```

To run the app, run
```
npm start
```

# Usage

Your mouse is attracting or pushing the particles.

| key | function |
| --- | -------- |
| space | Toggle between push/pull |
| r | Reset particles |
| b | Toggle bounds. If enabled, particles are contained in a box |
| s | Stop all particles |
| + or = | Increase mass of mouse |
| - | Decrease mass of mouse |
